License Terms

The Business Source License (this "License") is not an Open Source license. However, the
Licensed Work will be made available under the Change License on the Change Date as set
forth above.

1. Definitions
   "Licensor", "Licensed Work", "Additional Use Grant", "Change Date", and "Change License"
   have the meanings set forth in the Parameters above.
   "Production Use" means use of the Licensed Work in a production environment or in a
   manner intended for or directed toward third parties, commercial advantage, or internal
   production workloads. "Non-Production Use" means use solely for internal development,
   testing, or evaluation.

2. License Grant
   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor grants you a
   non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited license to use,
   copy, modify, create derivative works of, and redistribute the Licensed Work, in source
   or object form, for Non-Production Use and for any use expressly permitted by the
   Additional Use Grant.

3. Restrictions
   Except to the extent permitted by the Additional Use Grant, you may not use the Licensed
   Work for any Production Use before the Change Date. You must preserve all copyright,
   patent, trademark, and attribution notices in copies of the Licensed Work and in
   derivative works. You may not remove or alter any license notices.

4. Redistribution
   You may distribute the Licensed Work and your modifications in source or object form,
   provided that you reproduce this License (including the Parameters and disclaimers) with
   such distribution.

5. Change Date and Change License
   On or after the Change Date, the Change License specified above will apply to the
   Licensed Work, and this License will no longer apply to the Licensed Work.

6. Termination
   If you breach this License, your rights under it terminate automatically. The Licensor
   may offer reinstatement at its sole discretion under conditions it sets.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty
   THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
   EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
   OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

8. Limitation of Liability
   IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
   DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, ARISING OUT
   OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSED WORK OR THIS LICENSE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

9. Trademarks
   This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service
   marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
   customary use in describing the origin of the Licensed Work and reproducing the content
   of the copyright notice.

10. Patents
   No patent license is granted by this License, except to the limited extent necessary to
   exercise the permissions granted in Section 2.

11. Severability
   If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
   reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

12. Miscellaneous
   Any translation of this License is for convenience only. The English language version
   will control in the event of a conflict.

For the avoidance of doubt, prior to the Change Date, any Production Use not expressly
permitted by the Additional Use Grant requires a separate commercial license from the
Licensor.
